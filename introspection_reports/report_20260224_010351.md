**Function**: trigger_module_not_found_error

## 🚨 Error Analysis

**Error Type**: ModuleNotFoundError
**Error Message**: No module named 'non_existent_module_12345'

### 💻 Root Cause Analysis

**Cause**: Missing Python module
**Analysis**: 
From a chaos theory perspective, this error represents a divergence from the stable attractor (normal operation). The error is a bifurcation point where the system's behavior changed unexpectedly.

From an information theory perspective, this error increases system uncertainty (entropy). The repair attempt aims to perform entropy reduction by fixing the issue.

### 🔧 Repair Attempt

**Repair Attempted**: True
**Repair Result**:
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "action": "pip_install",
  "error": "[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'pip'"
}
```

## 💡 Theoretical Analysis

### 🧠 Chaos Theory Perspective
- **Attractor Divergence**: The error caused the system to diverge from its stable attractor.
- **Bifurcation Point**: The error is a bifurcation point where system behavior changed.
- **Chaos Management**: The repair attempt attempts to manage chaos by restoring stability.

### 💻 Information Theory Perspective
- **Entropy Reduction**: The error increased system entropy. The repair attempt aims to perform entropy reduction.
- **Information Density Optimization**: The error log provides high-density information (type, cause, repair).
- **Information Flow**: The repair action adjusts the information flow to restore normal operation.

### 🎮 Cybernetics Perspective
- **Feedback Control**: The error is feedback (negative feedback) indicating system deviation.
- **Adaptive Control**: The repair action is adaptive (based on error type and rules).
- **Stability Control**: The repair attempt aims to restore system stability.
